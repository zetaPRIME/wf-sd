# Zia's Integrated Deckframe
Warframe Steam Deck input configuration files



## Installation
Due to some details of how Warframe behaves, the input configuration won't be fully functional without key bindings that can't be set in the game itself if it's running through Steam on a Steam Deck. This script will install a replacement config file with all the bindings you need, plus a set of reasonable defaults for the Deck. (Your previous configuration )
1. Switch your Steam Deck to desktop mode and navigate to this page. (`https://github.com/zetaprime/wf-sd`)
1. [Download the installer file](https://github.com/zetaPRIME/wf-sd/releases/download/latest/wf-sd-install.desktop), drag it onto the desktop and double-click it. (If you're using Firefox, the file will be named `wf-sd-install.desktop.download`; rename it to `wf-sd-install.desktop` before trying to run it.)
1. Switch back to Gaming Mode, open Warframe's input configuration in the game profile screen (controller icon), and apply the latest version of "Zia's Integrated Deckframe" from Community Layouts.
1. Done! Launch the game and enjoy.

- - Alternatively, if you'd rather do it manually instead of trusting a script you found on the internet, you can download [EE.cfg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zetaPRIME/wf-sd/main/EE.cfg) and copy it into `/home/deck/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/230410/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Local/Warframe` using your file manager.
